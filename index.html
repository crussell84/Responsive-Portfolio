                <p>Hello and welcome! I'm a former software tester who is now venturing into the wild world of web development!
                    I worked with Agile software teams to develop mobile web applications for several years, which got me
                    interested in being able to do the development part of things as well. I'm currently enrolled in an awesome
                    bootcamp to aquire those skills, which I expect to complete around December of this year.
                </p>
                <p>In my off time, I read Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels, play video games, watch anime, and knit. I live with my
                    fiance in our home in Rochester, which we share with 3 cats, 2 snakes, 6 turtles, and far to many fish
                    to count.</p>
